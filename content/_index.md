# 👋 Welcome to Jens' API Docs
This website contains documentation for public APIs I made
which didn't have any docs before.

These are APIs that have been primarily built for use with my frontend (i.e. my own website)
and API design will definitely reflect that 😛.

## 🗒️ Contents
Currently, docs exist for:
- [Skin Renderer](https://skin-render.jensderuiter.dev)
- [Skin Generator](https://jens.skin)
